# Operating reading-lite

Deploying, ingesting in bulk, and repairing the corpus. `README.md` covers the
architecture and the HTTP API; this document is the operator runbook.

Operator workflows run through the unified plan-first CLI: `npm run ops --
<group> <command> [options]`. Every command with durable side effects prints a
plan by default and acts only with `--execute`.

Every `corpus` command additionally requires `--tenant <selector>` before it
plans anything: `global` addresses the pre-tenant layout production data lives
under today, and a `usr_…` tenant id addresses that tenant's `u/{tenantId}/`
key namespace plus its Vectorize namespace (the same roots the worker derives
from a validated `TenantContext`). There is no default — a missing or
malformed selector is a usage error (exit 2) before any R2 or Vectorize
traffic, so an operator can never act on the global corpus by omission.

## Environments

| Environment | Worker | Bucket / Vectorize index | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| local | `reading-lite-dev` | Miniflare-emulated R2 only | no Queue, no Vectorize |
| staging | `reading-lite-staging` | `reading-lite-staging` | `workers_dev` URL |
| production | `reading-lite` | `reading-lite` | routed at `reading-lite.bbell.dev/api/*` + `/health` |

Environments do **not** inherit top-level `[vars]` or bindings — `wrangler.toml`
repeats them per environment. The distinct dev Worker name guards against an
accidental bare `wrangler deploy` clobbering production.

`TENANT_DATA_PLANE=1` prefixes hosted R2 keys as `u/{tenantId}/…`. Leave it
unset in local, staging, and production until the founder corpus is copied
under that prefix (s1k.6). Workers-pool tests turn it on so two tenants can
share a URL without colliding. Operator corpus scripts still talk to the
global `readings/` and `index/` layout.

### Secrets

Runtime Worker secrets (`wrangler secret put --env staging|production`):

| Secret | When |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_ROOT_SECRET` | always — 256-bit hex HKDF root for credential HMACs |
| `AUTH_PREVIOUS_ROOT_SECRET` | optional — previous root during a bounded rotation window |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | always — embeddings, and the default OpenAI summarizer |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | only when `SUMMARIZER_PROVIDER=anthropic` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | optional — per-reading email notifications |

Optional version vars (`AUTH_ROOT_KEY_VERSION`, `AUTH_PREVIOUS_ROOT_KEY_VERSION`)
default to `1`. HKDF includes the version, so a secret-only rotation must keep
the previous root on the same version the tokens were minted with (the default).
Bump both version vars explicitly when advancing the key generation.

`founder-bootstrap` cannot read Wrangler secrets. Put the **same**
`AUTH_ROOT_SECRET` plus `READER_API_TOKEN` (and `FOUNDER_EMAIL` unless you pass
`--email`) in `.stg.vars` / `.prd.vars` or the process environment. A local
root that differs from the Worker secret produces HMACs the Worker cannot
verify. After import, `READER_API_TOKEN` is not a runtime Worker fallback;
keep it in the dotenv for operator CLIs that still POST that bearer.

`POST /api/readings` requests notification by default (`email: true`). Without
`RESEND_API_KEY` and the `EMAIL_*` / `WEB_BASE_URL` vars, submissions still
reach `ready` but log a failed `send_email` event; the reading is unaffected.

The offline corpus tools authenticate directly against Cloudflare rather than
through the Worker, and read `CORPUS_R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CORPUS_R2_ACCESS_KEY`,
`CORPUS_R2_SECRET_KEY`, and `CORPUS_CF_API_TOKEN` from the environment or
`.corpus.vars`.

### Deploying

Bring the control plane up before deploying a Worker that authenticates
against D1. `ops deploy worker` does not create the database, apply
migrations, or import the founder token, and `--execute` refuses placeholder
`CONTROL_PLANE` `database_id` values in `wrangler.toml`.

Staging:

```sh
cp .stg.vars.example .stg.vars   # AUTH_ROOT_SECRET, READER_API_TOKEN, FOUNDER_EMAIL, …
wrangler d1 create reading-lite-control-staging
# replace [env.staging] CONTROL_PLANE database_id in wrangler.toml
wrangler secret put AUTH_ROOT_SECRET --env staging   # same hex as .stg.vars
wrangler d1 migrations apply reading-lite-control-staging --env staging --remote
npm run ops -- founder bootstrap --email founder@example.com --env staging --execute
npm run ops -- deploy worker --env staging --execute
npm run ops -- deploy web --branch staging --execute
```

Production is the same sequence with `reading-lite-control`, `--env production`,
`.prd.vars`, and:

```sh
npm run ops -- founder bootstrap --email founder@example.com --env production \
  --execute --confirm-production
npm run ops -- deploy worker --env production --execute
npm run ops -- deploy web --branch main --execute
```

The imported founder token expires after 90 days; re-running the same
bootstrap command refreshes `expires_at_ms` and clears a revoked row.

`ops deploy worker` targets only staging and production (`--env`), so a dev
Worker can never be uploaded by mistake. `ops deploy web --skip-build` reuses
an existing SPA build.

Local `npm run dev` runs `dev:setup` first (local D1 migrations + founder
bootstrap of `dev-local-token`).

The SPA is served from Cloudflare Pages on the same custom domain as the Worker;
Worker routes are scoped to `/api/*` and `/health` so Pages handles every other
path.

### Staging lifecycle

Staging exists for real end-to-end smoke tests that need Queue, R2, and
Vectorize without mutating the production corpus. Both lifecycle scripts are
hard-coded to staging resource names, refuse production-looking names, and are
idempotent — "already exists" on setup and "already gone" on teardown are
treated as success, while unexpected Wrangler or R2 API failures stop the run.

```sh
npm run ops -- staging setup --execute
npm run ops -- staging teardown --execute
```

Teardown removes Queue consumers before deleting the Worker, then deletes the
Queue/DLQ and Vectorize index, empties the bucket via the S3-compatible R2 API,
and deletes the bucket. The bucket-empty step needs the `CORPUS_R2_*`
credentials above.

Smoke-test idempotent submits against staging:

```sh
VARS_FILE=.stg.vars BASE=https://reading-lite-staging.<workers-subdomain>.workers.dev \
  ./scripts/manual/idempotency-smoke.sh a "https://example.com/reading-lite-staging-$RANDOM"
```

Clean up the throwaways afterwards, including `ready` ones:

```sh
npm run ops -- corpus audit --tenant global --bucket reading-lite-staging --execute
npm run ops -- corpus drop "https://example.com/reading-lite-staging-123" \
  --bucket reading-lite-staging --allow-ready \
  --vectorize reading-lite-staging --execute
```

## Diagnosing a single reading

`GET /api/readings/:id/diagnostics` shows whether the by-id and by-url pointers
line up, which R2 objects exist, the list-index row, and the recent attempt
records — including which stage failed (`fetch_source`, `embed_source`,
`summarize`, `upsert_vector`, `write_indexes`, …). Each background run stages an
attempt record under `readings/.../attempts/{attempt_id}.json` with the trigger,
stage, timings, and sanitized error details, so failures are inspectable without
`wrangler tail`.

`POST /api/readings/:id/reprocess` retries that exact id. A failed reading
becomes `pending` while the attempt runs. A ready reading keeps its current
manifest as the fallback: a successful attempt replaces the manifest and vector,
and a failed one preserves the ready manifest with
`last_attempt.status = "failed"`.

## Corpus tools

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run ops -- corpus audit` | inventory of every non-ready reading, classified by failure reason (plans by default; `--execute` writes `index.json` + `INDEX.md`) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus recover` | acts on an audit: reprocess or re-extract per a per-reason policy table (plans by default; `--execute` submits) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus drop` | remove readings by URL or id (`--allow-ready` also clears the vector) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus sweep` | reconcile duplicate copies of one resource across URL spellings (keeps the best, drops the rest with their vectors) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus backfill-similarity` | fill in `manifest.similarity` for readings written before the field existed (no embedding calls; writes only that field) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus backfill-vectors` | restore missing Vectorize vectors by re-embedding stored TL;DRs (writes Vectorize only; R2 stays read-only) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus normalize-tags` | rewrite stored tags into canonical hyphenated form (writes only `manifest.tags`) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus rebuild-list` | rewrite `index/list.json` from live manifests (backfill list-row fields) |
| `npm run ops -- corpus delete-orphans` | remove orphan-duplicate pending readings consistently |
| `npm run ops -- corpus ingest` | bulk-ingest a fresh markdown directory through a provider Batch API |

`ops corpus rebuild-list` re-projects every indexed manifest through
`manifestToIndexItem` and writes `index/list.json`. Use it after deploying a
Worker that added list-row fields (keywords, for `q` search) so existing
readings become searchable without a paid reprocess. Dry-run by default;
`--execute` requires `--sole-writer` because the rewrite is a plain put.

```sh
npm run ops -- corpus rebuild-list --tenant global --bucket reading-lite
npm run ops -- corpus rebuild-list --tenant global --bucket reading-lite --execute --sole-writer
```

Deploy the new Worker **before** the production rewrite. An old Worker that
later commits a terminal manifest would strip the new fields off that row.

`ops corpus recover` has two execution paths: `--wave` paces realtime
submissions through `POST /api/readings/:id/reprocess`, and `--batch` routes the
same work through the offline provider Batch API path described below.

```sh
npm run ops -- corpus audit --tenant global --execute      # writes index.json + INDEX.md
npm run ops -- corpus recover --tenant global --index ./index.json --execute
```

### The extract-agent

Some sites hard-block Cloudflare datacenter egress, so the Worker's
`fetch_source` fails where a residential IP succeeds. `ops extract agent`
polls the reading API for `fetch_source`-failed readings and re-extracts them
locally: an SSRF-guarded static tier with browser headers, falling back to a
headless Playwright render when the static tier is challenged or finds no real
article, plus an anonymous Reddit thread-JSON path. Successful markdown re-enters
through `POST /api/readings/import-markdown`.

```sh
npm run ops -- extract agent [--execute] [--limit N] [--only <id|url>] [--verbose]
```

Every submit is a paid action, so runs plan by default and are capped per
run. Plan mode persists nothing; on `--execute` a lockfile prevents two
overlapping runs from double-submitting, the run appends a JSON line to the
run log, and a completed run pings a dead-man healthcheck. Configuration lives in `.extract-agent.vars` (gitignored)
or the environment; the knobs are documented in
`scripts/extract-agent-lib/config.ts`. Reddit threads that answer with a
challenge are recorded as durable `manual` outcomes and left for the
`reddit-import` skill.

## Bulk ingest

### Chrome bookmarks

Ingests URLs from a Chrome bookmark export, asking `Y/n/q` before each URL
(Enter or `y` submits, `n` skips, `q` aborts).

```sh
npm run ops -- import bookmarks --file ~/Downloads/bookmarks.html --execute
npm run ops -- import bookmarks --file ~/Downloads/bookmarks.html --execute --quick
npm run ops -- import bookmarks --file ~/Downloads/bookmarks.html --execute \
  --folder "Computing/AI/MCP" --url https://reading-lite.bbell.dev/api/readings
```

The default folder is `Computing` (top-level, i.e. under "Other Bookmarks").
`--url` is the **full** readings endpoint (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/readings`,
or `READER_URL`). Omitting `--execute` prints the would-submit list without prompting or
POSTing. `--quick` skips the per-URL prompt; submission is always serial so the
local index can't race itself. Token resolution mirrors `ops reading submit`:
`--token` > `READER_API_TOKEN` env > `.dev.vars`.

Transport-level fetch failures retry twice (250 ms / 500 ms); errors surface
their underlying cause. `new`/`existing` responses are recorded in
`.import-bookmarks-index.json` (scoped per destination URL) immediately, so an
interrupted run resumes; errors are *not* recorded, so the next run retries
them. The Worker also dedupes via the by-url pointer, so deleting the local
index is safe — it just re-POSTs every URL once to rebuild it.

### Local markdown

Imports `.md` files without re-fetching their source URLs. Each file must carry
a source line:

```md
**Source:** https://example.com/article
```

That URL becomes the canonical reading URL and the body is sent to
`POST /api/readings/import-markdown`. Duplicate files sharing a source URL are
collapsed before submit — the largest file wins. Imported readings store the
markdown as both raw content and `extracted.md`, then reuse the normal
embedding, similarity, summary, Vectorize, manifest, and list-index pipeline.

```sh
npm run ops -- import markdown --dir ~/Documents/articles           # plan, no token needed
npm run ops -- import markdown --dir ~/Documents/articles --execute  # local dev
npm run ops -- import markdown --dir ~/Documents/articles --execute \
  --url https://reading-lite.bbell.dev/api/readings/import-markdown
```

`--url` is the full import endpoint; token resolution matches the other scripts.
Files above the Cloudflare Queues 128 KB message limit are blocked before any
POST. Successful new/existing responses are recorded in
`.import-markdown-index.json` (scoped by destination URL) and move every file
for that source URL into a `processed/` subdirectory. Email is off by default;
pass `--email` to request notifications.

### Provider Batch APIs

`import-markdown` summarizes every file **realtime** through the Worker queue.
For large backfills, `ops corpus ingest` runs the same directory through the
configured provider's **Batch API**, and `ops corpus recover --tenant global --batch` does the same
for readings already in the corpus. Both talk to R2 and Vectorize directly with
`CORPUS_R2_*` credentials rather than through the HTTP API, and both need
`CORPUS_CF_API_TOKEN` plus `OPENAI_API_KEY` (embeddings); `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is
needed only to start or resume an Anthropic batch. `--execute` requires the
applicable credentials; a dry run degrades to the local plan without them. There
is no cross-provider fallback.

```sh
# dry run (default): print the plan; with creds it also shows ownership skips
npm run ops -- corpus ingest --tenant global --dir ~/Documents/articles

# for real — confirm the realtime writer is paused/drained first
npm run ops -- corpus ingest --tenant global --dir ~/Documents/articles \
  --execute --sole-writer --bucket reading-lite
```

The resulting `ready` manifests are contract-compatible with the realtime import
path (`source_type: "markdown"`, captured content, correct
`content_bytes`/`content_sha256`, `usage.openai_embedding_tokens`, by-url and
by-id pointers, a Vectorize vector, and an `index/list.json` row). Both batch
paths omit the realtime attempt-log fields (`last_attempt` and the per-attempt
objects under the key prefix).

**`--sole-writer` is enforced, not assumed.** `ops corpus ingest --tenant global --execute` and
`ops corpus recover --tenant global --batch --execute` refuse to submit without it. Both batch paths
eagerly claim by-url slots (recover via a failed→pending flip that keeps its
claim on failure, so the URL stays re-submittable), but that claim is
defense-in-depth rather than a replacement for pausing the realtime writer. An
acknowledged run prints a loud banner before any submit; dry runs submit nothing
and never require the flag. The enforcement lives in
`scripts/corpus-lib/sole-writer.ts`.

**Idempotency** is resolved client-side from `index/by-url/{sha256(url)}` by the
same rules as the Worker's `ReadingClaim`: a pointer counts as owner only when
its manifest actually matches (id + url + url_hash), so ready and pending owners
are skipped while failed owners re-ingest in place; a fresh pointer whose
manifest hasn't landed yet is treated as still-initializing and skipped (a
realtime submit may be in flight); unclaimed URLs mint a new reading; and
damaged or mismatched pointers are skipped for operator repair rather than
claimed over. With no by-url pointer at all, the tools first run the Worker's
cold-legacy lookup (`findManifestByUrl` over `index/list.json`), so a prior
legacy failed ingest with a by-id pointer and list row but no by-url pointer is
re-ingested in place instead of duplicated. Pending owners are skipped even past
`PENDING_TTL_SECONDS`: this offline path cannot safely supersede a queue worker
that may still be running, so a stranded pending is left to heal via the
realtime API or `ops corpus recover`.

**Sizing.** Before any fresh eager activation write, the batch path preflights
the provider payload, resolves similar-reading context, then validates the final
request payload. OpenAI JSONL is measured as exact UTF-8 bytes and capped at
50,000 requests and 190 MB; Anthropic payloads use a 200 MB safety cap. If a run
is too large, rerun with `--limit` to split it without leaving pending owners
behind.

**Resume.** The in-flight batch is recorded in a versioned sidecar
(`./corpus-ingest.batch.json` by default); re-running resumes that batch instead
of creating a second, double-billed one. The sidecar pins provider, model,
OpenAI reasoning effort, and a stable run id, so an environment change cannot
switch a resume to another provider. OpenAI's pre-submit upload/create phases are
persisted — a companion `<sidecar>.input.jsonl` holds the exact JSONL bytes,
written before the `uploading` checkpoint. On resume the reconciler adopts what
already exists: remote files by filename (`reading-lite-${runId}.jsonl`), remote
batches by `metadata.run_id`. A sidecar-scoped file lock serializes the initial
upload/create transition against any later resume.

The expensive `create` step is deliberately **fail-closed**: a list-then-create
cannot distinguish a successful-but-lost-response prior create from a failed one
(the OpenAI Batch API has no idempotency key, and listing can lag), so an
ambiguous match or no visible remote batch at the create step aborts and asks
for a manual reconcile. Anthropic pre-submit and OpenAI `activating` sidecars
also require manual reconcile. If a batch fails, the write phase releases the
eager by-url claim only when the pointer still exactly matches the failed target.

Claim, release, and crash-resume semantics are specified in
`scripts/corpus-lib/batch/activation-phase.ts`, `write-phase.ts`,
`prepare-fresh-markdown.ts`, and `openai-reconcile.ts`; `run.ts`'s header
documents the shared phase ordering.

## Sources that need a local skill

### Reddit

Reddit serves a bot challenge to datacenter egress, so the Worker cannot fetch
thread JSON — `POST /api/readings` with a `reddit.com` / `redd.it` URL
deliberately lands `failed`. Use the **`reddit-import`** skill instead: it drives
a logged-in Chrome session to fetch the public `<thread>.json`, renders the post
plus top comments to markdown with the same parser the Worker uses, and imports
it via `POST /api/readings/import-markdown`. No Reddit app or OAuth credentials
are needed. The skill wraps `ops import reddit <redditUrl> --json <saved.json>`,
which plans by default (omit `--execute`) to preview the markdown.

### YouTube

YouTube watch pages have no server-rendered article body, so the extractor
handles them in-worker rather than through Readability. Submitting a
`youtube.com/watch`, `youtu.be`, `shorts`, `live`, or `embed` URL builds markdown
from the public oEmbed metadata (title + author — the reliable floor), plus a
best-effort description (from the page's `ytInitialPlayerResponse`) and
transcript (the first caption track) when YouTube serves them. Unlike Reddit the
URL summarizes to `ready` directly, but in practice the Worker is usually blocked
from the watch page and lands the floor only.

For a full extraction — description plus transcript — run the
**`youtube-import`** skill locally, which fetches the watch page from your
residential IP and uses `yt-dlp` for the transcript, then imports the rich
markdown through the same parsers the Worker uses. Requires `yt-dlp` on PATH.

```sh
npm run ops -- import youtube "<youtubeUrl>" --execute   # omit --execute to preview
```

## Seeding local R2

To exercise the read path or the SPA against real data locally, seed the local
bucket and then restart `wrangler dev` — the running dev server caches R2
in-process. Seed via **Miniflare** (persist path `.wrangler/state/v3/r2`, bucket
`reading-lite`), *not* `wrangler r2 object put --local`, which writes to a
different local store the dev server never reads.

A minimal `ready` reading needs:

- `readings/<key_prefix>/manifest.json` — a valid `ManifestSchema` with
  `content_status: "captured"`
- `index/by-id/<id>`
- `index/by-url/<url_hash>` — matching the manifest's `url_hash`
- a row in `index/list.json`
- `readings/<key_prefix>/extracted.md` — for `/content`
- `readings/<key_prefix>/raw.{ext}` matching the manifest's `content_type` — for
  `/content/raw`

`/lookup` requires the by-url pointer and does not discover pointerless readings.
